# My solutions to the foo.bar challenge of Google

I got invited to the foo.bar challenge! 

This folder presents my solutions coded in Python.

The file names have two numbers:
  - the first number represents the problem's level in the challenge
  - the second number represents the number of the problem in its level
  
Exercise 1 at level 1: 
  count repetitive pattern in a string

Exercise 1 at level 2: 
  calculate value in a matrix based on row and column indices, and previous elements in the table.
  
Exercise 2 at level 2: 
  sort element of a list using a user-defined key function
  
Exercise 1 at level 3:
  use dynamyc programming (bottom-up approach implemented) to solve a problem
  
Exercise 2 at level 3:
  use dictionarries to collect information while scanning a list and post-process the information efficiently (quickly)
  
Exercise 3 at level 3:
  solve a problem by considering the binary representation of a number and employing an iterative approach 
  
Exercise 4 at level 1:
  solve a max flow problem with multiple sources and sinks
  
  I implemented Edmonds-Karp algorithm using a residual capacity matrix, a dictionary to represent the adjacency lists, 
  a list of parent node to store information to reconstitute paths, and a queue to store current nodes of the breadth-first search.
